# Tableau Data Story
## Summary
The visualisation is a brief walk through the tragic sinking of the Titanic more
than 100 years ago.
The key finding is that women had a survival rate of more than 70%, while less
than 20% of all men on board survived. For women travelling in the first or second
class that rate was even higher.
Also children had a higher rate of survival suggesting that "women and children
first" held true on board of Titanic.

## Design
The main objective was to show the higher chance of survival that women on board
of the Titanic had. This is why most graphs and visualisations are split by gender.
The feedback that the visual encoding of gender was not consistent as well as not always
in place was very important to create a red line in the story.
Also the first version that included different bar charts which showed that gender
had the highest impact did not communicate it as clearly as I wished. So I decided
to go for a scatterplot that shows the impact of the class and gender on the chance
to survive.
In general the final version focused to only show a few, meaningful distribution
plots that compared the rate of survival between classes.

## Feedback
### story_v1
+ good introduction of the dataset
+ visualisation types are well picked
- visualisations in first two sections are hidden
- colour formatting is not consistent

### story_v2
- summary is missing
- dive into survival is missing
- dashboard is rather a selection of questions
-> create story around findings
